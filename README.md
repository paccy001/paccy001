### And... here you're, welcome to my Github page!

> This page belongs to a 20yo (not yet but soon!) Rwandan Developer, me ... 😄😎.

Although my eyes aren’t sufficient for themselves and require glasses to see clearly, I’m a detail-oriented Back End Developer! Since 2020, I’ve been exploring the mysteries of web development (especially Back End Development). Fortunately, I know that continuous learning is the only thing that can save me from getting lost in this series of endless tech conundrums!

> Wasn't that a cool intro 😎? I now that maybe you're getting bored! Let's jump straight into my qualities & skills:

Qualities:
- **Thoughtful** : I cares about the overall result, not just my piece of code in a project. 
- **Reliable & Self-Organized** : I rarely have difficulties meeting deadlines, I accurately calculate my resources, and I do not require external control.
- **Communicable** : I have no problem communicating with colleagues and clients.
- **Highly Expert** : To consider my self as a good fit for a position/project, I always make sure that I have deep understanding of the technologies I'll use.
- **High Learning Ability** , **Team Player** , **Focused on a big picure** , and **System Thinker**...

> Trynna keep you focused but I think I'm failing 😔, I know you like jokes! Hope this will maintain your good vibes, “why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!” 😄🌙

> Now it's time for showcasing my skills, sadly, I can't list everything I know in tech since I like to try new things... I just added what I mostly use.

Skills:
- Back End Development : `NodeJS (Express.js & Nest.js)`, `Java (Spring Boot)`.
- Front End Development: `React`,`Next.js`. Only when I'm helping frontend devs or when were approaching deadlines/intergrating APIs... I just don't like it!
- Mobile Apps Development: `React Native`. Sometimes I write them... But not a primarly skill!
- Cloud Services: `Microsoft Azure`, `AWS`
- Testing Frameworks: `Mocha`, `Jest`, `Vitest`, `Supatest`, `Cypress`.
- DevOps: `CI/CD`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`...
- Hosting web services is also on the list ... 👍

> Sound like a whole IT department right?😄 - My eager to learn brought me here, still working to get others!

> By the way, Congratulations for making this fall... Never thought that there is a person who wants to know me this much 🤭.

> The final part is here! `Projectss..sss`, I deeply know that it's the know you were looking for 😄 made it the last on purpose 😎

Project:
> [!Important]
> You're already in the ocean of my past/current/future plans and works, just explore! Too many good projects that weren't listed.

> [!Note]
> Apart from those listed project, as an opensource enthusiast, I've contributed to `Node.js`, `Vercel labs`, `Nuxt`, `Nest.js`, `Pixi.js`, `auth0` and many more. Though my contributions were not that big but I gained experience that drives me as a good Software Engineer.
